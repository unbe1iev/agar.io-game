# agar.io-game
This is the once popular agar.io game.

I create an old, iconic browser game in JS, called agar.io.
HTML/CSS/JS/CANVAS

The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.
The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.
